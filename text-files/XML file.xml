<p>St. Petersburg, November 4.
The Amnesty is of the widest description,
Applying especially- to political offenders.
There are no signs of Russia becoming
quieter. Great disturbances and bloodshed are
reported daily from fresh places.
The latest reports show that the horrors at
Odessa were not exaggerated. Hooligans aided
by the police slaughtered whole families of
Jews, with inconceivable brutality. It is impos-
sible to estimate the number of the killed, but
there ate at present 5,500 wounded in. the
hospitals. 300 corpses have already been
buried.	(Reuter)</p>

been sent to Odessa and elsewhere to restore
order. The other Embassies have made similar
representations.	(Reuter) </p>

<p>The railway strike in Russia is ending. M.
Witte has informed the strikers that their
demands have been granted. The police at
Odessa have tardily taken measures to put an
end to the slaughter of the Jews.
Bloodshed continues elsewhere. A hundred
were killed and six hundred wounded at
Minsk.
The resignation of the' Minister of the
Interior, M. Bouliguine, has been accepted.
A manifesto of the Tsar convokes the
Finnish diet for the 28th December, in view of
the revision of electoral representation. It
abolishes the Dictatorship. Meanwhile four
warships, convoying ten thousand troops, have
anchored at Helsiugfurs.	,
A great Socialist demonstration which had
been, arranged for to-day has been abandoned
owing to the stem threat of General Trepoff to
repress disturbances rigorously.
An official communication declares that it
is indispensable that all classes should refrain
from mutual friction in order to avoid'disturb-
ances, which the Government must repress for
the protection of Russian citizens without
distinction.	(Reuter) </p>

<p>Theft in a Gouvernorat.— A sum of about
L.E. 20 has been stolen from a safe in tbe
private enquiry department at the Cairo
Gouvernorat. The safe contained L.E. 66.</p>

states that a poor woman of Damanhour has
given birth to seven children, four males and
three lerooles. The mother is doing well, but
two of tbe boys and two of the girls died
shortly after birth.</p>
<p>Thefts at Alexandria —A local contem-
porary persists in denying the existence of a
band of robbers at Alexandria, who have
recently committed a number of thefts. The
statement can be proved by repairing to tbe
scene of their operations in Sisters-street and
at the establishment of the Sisters of St.
Vincent de Paul.</p>
<p>Woman Strangled.—A native woman, 35
years of age, of the name of Aysha and belong-

this to correct tbe impression that tbe name
of tbe institution has been changed. Miss
Maclnnes, tbe acting president, returned to
Cairo last month.</p>
<head>MINISTRY OF FINANCE.
A SECOND UNDER SECRETARY
OF STATE.</head>
<p>Owing to tho greatly increased pressure of
work at the Ministry of Finanoe, it has been
decided to appoint anothor Under-Secretary
of State, and Lord Edward Cecil Pasha has
been selected to fill the new post. Great sa-
tisfaction is expressed both in British and
native circles at his appointment.
During his career in the Sudan servioe
Lord Edward Cecil has displayed in a marked
degreo the qualities of a good administrator.
He is thirty-eight, a brilliant soldier, and a
man of business as well as of affairs. The be-
sieged in Mafeking owe him a large debt.
They hod pretty bad times there long before
the siege was over, but had it not been for
Lord Edward Cecil they would have starved
long before relief came. He took upon himself
the responsibility of providing the town with
just four times the quantity of food the military
authorities found necessary, and when the
contractors hesitated to exeoote a seven
thousand pound order on the young major’s
sole responsibility, Lord Edward promptly
got Baden-Powell to back the bilL. But
Muafeking was only one incident in his
career. He has served in Egypt several times,
accompanied the famous special mission to
King Menelik ot Abyssinis, gained two medals
for his services with the Dougoia Expedition,
earned more fame at Atbara, and added to it
at Omdurman the D. S. O. and two clasps. The
mission to Menelik, by the way, nearly put an
end to Lord Edward’s career. While the party
was on its way uue of the camels fell down a
deep ravine, aud Lord Edward and Captain
Swayne clambered down a rope of puggarees
with the idea of rescuing the animal. They
could not roach the camel, however, and one
of the Abyssinians went down. A moment
later two shots rang out—one ot them came
pretty near to hitting Sir Rennell Rodd—-and
the native caino up hand over hand in doable-
quick time. He had found two lions devour-
ing tbe camel! Lord Edward, who is, of course,
a younger brother of tbe Marquess of Salis-
bury, married in 1894 Miss Violet Maxse,
daughter of tbe late Admiral Maxse, and
sister to the editor of the “National Review."
As a girl, Lady Edward Cecil sat for Millais'
"Puss in Boots,” and during the Boer war she
did splendid work among the sick and
wounded. </p>

<head>AMERICAN INSURANCE SCANDALS.</head>
<p>Our recent article on the American insurance
scandals has been interpreted by some persons
here, whose knowledge of English is limited,
as reflecting on the agents in Egypt of the
companies concerned. But the idea that the
article had any reference to anyone in Egypt
is of coarse quite absurd, and it will not bear
that interpretation for a moment to anyone
conversant with the English language.</p>

ister, Mustapha Pasha Fehmy, Fakhry Pasha,
Fuad Pasha, tbe chiefs of the ulema, and the
principal dignitaries of the University of Al
Azhar, Mr. Moberly, acting Commandant of
the Cairo Police, and a great number of
notables and sheikhs were present. The fu-
neral service was bald at the Mosque of the Al
Azhar University, after which the foneral
cortege moved on to the cemetery at El Me-
gaonerin, where the interment took place.
The late  Grand Mufti appears to have suc-
cumbed to heart failure while driving from the
house of H. E. Boutros Pasha Ghali to that
of H.E. Ahmed Pasha Mazloum to con-
clude a series ot official visits which seem to
have proved too fatiguing for his years. His
friends state that he showed no signs of illness
when leaving his house in the late afternoon.
A successor to the Grand Mufti has already
been found in Sheikh Bakri Ashour, the acting
Grand Cadi, who has aocepted the appointment.
Sheikh Bakri is reputed to be a learned theo-
logian and bears a high personal character.<p>

<head>CHRYSANTHEMUM. SHOWS.
SUCCESSFUL EXHIBITS AT
ALEXANDRIA.</head>
<p>The eighth of the Alexandria Horticultural
Society’s Chrysanthemum Shows was held in
the San Stefano Casino on Saturday and
Sunday last. It was the largest yet held here,
and was remarkable for the number of novel
exhibits it contained, this, evidently, being
the result of according a oertain number of
points in tho programme for new varieties not
hitherto exhibited in Egypt. Every year brings
one or two new exhibitors who show extra-
ordinarily good blossoms. Mr. Rolo surprised
the public last year by his beautiful cut flowers a
in boxes, and this year Madame Salvago and
Yehia Bey, who never exhibited before, were
able to carry off prizes in every class for which ,
they (competed. The group of Mme Salvago,
though small, was quite charming, and the
fine heads of flowers that Yehia Bey produced
were as good as any that have been seen at
San Stefano. But to those who really under-
stand chrysanthemums and their culture, the
great feature of the show was undoubtedly
the mass of pot plants in the centre of Mr.
Zervndachi’s gronp, which had been so culti-
vated that while the plant remained small,
the bloom was as large as if the roots had not
been touohed.
The ball-room of the Casino was completely
filled by four large groups, three of which were
for competition, while the fourth was the
exhibit of the Municipality, which never com-
petes. All showed great taste in arrangement,
and the harmony in colour in each was well
thought out. The difficulty consequently lay in
judging the strength of the plant and in the
value of the new importations into Egypt
Perhaps among all the exhibitors the greatest
stride has been made by the Municipality; the
difference in the grouping of their plants was
greatly noticeable. The Municipality is now
taking great interest in the culture of flowers.
The reading-room was also quite full of
plants; the blossoms were enormous and
although most of the prizes seemed to go
to three or four (competitors, yet in every class
there was much competition. Cultivation of the
chrysanthemum has become so general in
Alexandria, that it almost seems as if the
committee might venture to take a further
step, and offer prizes for special classes suoh as
Pompou, Incurves, etc. We must not omit to
mention the boxes of well-grown flowers staged
by General Bullock, nor the interesting exhibit
of Mrs. Crafton, consisting of the leaf, flower,
and fruit of the Philodendron pertusum. It is
not generally known that the fruit, which
tastes like pineapple, takes 18 months to ripen.
There was a mass of vases arranged by
natives, most of them well thought oat, though
perhaps the harmony of colour which generally
pleases the Earopean eye, was somewhat
wanting. Asa trial the oommittee offered prizes
for collections of vegetables, salad, and fruit,
without speoifiying too varieties. These exhibits
were a success, and showed the pnblic several
vegetables which they probably had no idea
were at the present time to be obtained in the
market. We noticed, for instance, peas, figs,
and strawberry grapes.
The attendance on the opening day showed
a marked increase on former years, while on
Sunday the attraction of the Armenian bend
helped to swell the large number who were
drawn to the show.
The following are the names of the judges :—
Miss Borchgrevink, Mrs. Crafton, Messrs.
Ebell, Monfront, H Seffer, and Tramontins.</p>

<head>THE CAIRO EXHIBITION.
    HIGH STANDARD Of EXHIBITS.</head>
<p>Saturday and Sunday's Chrysanthemum Show
at Cairo was a thorough saocess from the point of
view of the judges, and the weather was delight-
fully cool and pleasant, with the result that
the attendance was satisfactory and ths visitors
to the K. A.S building were content. The
exhibits in nearly all cases reached a very
high standard, some of the groups being
remarkably beautiful, and the cut flowers
attracting great attention. Mrs. Foaden, who
was by far tbe most successful exhibitor,
secured no less than eleven first prizes, her
groups consisting of splendidly healthy
blooms, and her other exhibits being extremely
tastefully arranged. Lord Cromer visited the
Show early on Satnrday afternoon, as did the
Prime Minister and Husseith Fakhry Pasha
and many other well-known Cairo personalities,
and there was a very fair attendance on the
second afternoon of the show. We need not
say that the arrangements were excellent, and
that the excellent tea that was provided and
the music, for which we have to thank the
C. O. of the 2nd Royal Inniskilling Fosiliers,
were heartily appreciated.
The following were the prize-winners in the
various clasaes of exhibits:-</p>

<head>THE SUCRBRIES COMPANY.
    MEETING OP DEBENTURE HOLDERS.</head>
<p>A meeting of tbe debenture-holders of the
Egyptian Sugar Refineries was held recently in
Paris, at which, on tbe initiative of the French
Council of Foreign Bondholders, a committee
was formod (the Paris correspondent of the
"Financial News" states) with the fullest
powers to safeguard their interests before the
Cairo Tribunal of Commerce. The creditors of
the unfortunate concern have again been con-
vened for November 17, after having met on
October 18 last, to receive the report of the
experts.This dcoament,the correspondent says,
particularly incriminates the board of di-
rectors which up till last year distributed
dividends, whilst the company’s business never
resulted in a single centime profit. On the
contrary, for the last five years the Egyptian
Sugar Refineries constantly worked at a loss,
which did not appear in the obviously
"doctored” balance-sheets.
As to tbe notorious Cronier bills which the
managing directors aocepted, unknown to their
colleagues of the board, the experts declare
they were duly entered in the oompany's
books; but the items reffering to that account
were subsequently omitted from the balance-
sheets. Moreover, the bills once paid by the
company could not be found until they were
discovered at the private residence of a subor-
dinate employe, who had staetd that he bad
never seen them.
The debenture-holders will now await the
meeting of November 17,when the experts will
read a supplementary report, whioh will also
set forth the exact state of the assets and
liabilities of the company. </p>

<head>RUSSIA’S LAST FIGHT.
REVOLUTIONISTS' SWAY. </head>
<head>M. WITTE AND HIS CABINET.</head>
<p>St. Petersburg, November 6.
News of continual anti-Semitic and anti-
liberal riots continues to arrive from all parts,
from Archangel to Tiflis and from Poland to
Tomsk. They are generally the result of what
are called patriotic or conservative manifesta-
tions, which are organized under the auspices
of the police, and formed of mobs headed by
the Imperial banner or by a portrait of the
Tsar.
There have been hundreds oi killed and
wounded at Rostoff-on-Don and at Krement-
chug.	(Reuter)</p>
<head>St. Petersburg, November 6. </head>
<p>The Tsar's manifesto restoring all the an-
cient liberties of Finland has been published
at Helsingfors.The constitutionalists are sa-
tisfied, but the revolutionaries demand further
concessions.
The revolutionists have proved their control
over the masses by countermanding yester-
day's demonstration, announcing that they
would choose their own day, and not accept
one of Trepoff's choosing, for the last fight.
M. Witte has not made the least progress in
the formation of a Cabinet The Conservatives
avoid him ; the Liberals show themselves dis-
trustful, while the reactionaries detest him.
A few weeks' full is expected, during which
the revolutionary party will perfect their
organisation.
A fresh manifesto assures the people that
the reforms will be inflexibly carried out
despite the efforts of the enemies of reform,
but the Government must have the coopera-
tion of the pacific majority.	{Reuter)</p>

<p>Mysterious Murder —A servant of Abdel

savagely and then strangled him, forcing the
point of a stick which reached the brain into
his skull. Ths Kafr el Zayat authorities have
opened an enquiry. Hassan Effendi Faid, the

advanced of their guilt.</p>

<p>Mr. W. T. Stead has arrived in Copenhagen
from Helsingfors and has had a long private
interview with the Dowager Empress ot Russia,
in which he said that the gravity of the situa-
tion in Russia cannot be overestimated. Mr.
Stead predicted gigantic massacres, and he
believes that the reforms have oome too late.

    <head>ACTIVE SERVICE IN CRETE.</head>
<p>The following order was issued yesterday
by Brig.-General Bullock, C.B. commanding
the Army of Occupation :—
The General Officer Commanding hereby
declares that, by reason of the recent exis-
tence of active service in the Island of Crete,
it is, in his opinion, necessary for the Public
Service that the British Forces in the Island
aforesaid shall continue temporarily subject
to the Army Act as if they were on active
service, with effect from 31st October, 1905,
and until 30th November, 1905, both dates
inclusive.</p>
    <head>THE NEW GRAND MUFTI.</head>
<p>The new Grand Mufti, Sheikh Bakri Moha-
med Ashour El Sedfi, has entered immediately
on his new post. He is a well-known personality
among the Moslem religious notables and a
follower of the Hanafi rite. He was educated
at Al Azhar, where he became ulema after
showing considerable theological proficiency,
and was for a long period Mufti to the now
suppressed Beit-el-Mal Administration. He
was later appointed to the Mehkemeh High
Court as Cadi and showed such legal and
theological acumen that he gained the good
opinion of the bulk of Egyptian Moslems.
He was acting as Grand Cadi in the place of
Sheikh Yehia, who has gone on an important
errand to Constantinople, when the death of
Sheikh Abdul Kader El Raffei threw open to
him the Grand Muftiship of Egypt.
One of our Cairo contemporaries states that
the Ministry of Jnstice is at present discussing
the question whether the new Grand Mufti
can still perform his functions of Grand Cadi
per interim, or whether some one else must be
appointed to replace Sheikh Yehia during his
absence in Turkey.</p>
    <head>THE SUCRERIES.</head>

Arment, and Mataana, a task which will, it
is expected, employ their energies for at least
another week. The third and, let us hope, the
final report of the experts is expected to be
completed by Thursday, the 18th inst.</p>
<head>ANGLO-EGYPTIAN LAND
    ALLOTMENT.</head>
<p>Letters of allotment for the shares of the
Anglo-Egyptian Land Allotment Company

through by Messrs. Russell and Kerr, chartered
accountants, of Cairo.
Dr. Axil Th. Preyer has joined the board
of the Anglo-Egyptian Land Allotment Co.
Mr. Crewe, who was till now agent for the
National Bank of Egypt at the Mousky branch,
Cairo, has been appointed sub-manager to the
Egyptian Land Allotment Co., under a con
contract of ten years, and with a salary of£720
per annum.</p>
<head>NORTH EGYPT LAND CO.</head>
<p>With reference to the statement of a local
contemporary in its issue of last Saturday,
re the North Egypt Land Co., L-d, we may
point out that the oompany are not wholly
dependent on “providential rainfalls” for
raising their crops on their Mariout property,
as there are already a number of wells which
irrigate the land, and many more are to be
sunk. But leaving aside the decision of the
Irrigation Department not to extend the Nu-
barieh Canal for the present, there is another
scheme about to be proposed to the Govern-
ment which will afford ample means for irrigat
ing not only the fifteen thousand feddans at
present owned by the company, but a good
deal more.</p>
    <head>STEAMER MOVEMENTS.</head>
<p>The Ellerman S.S. Britannia sailed from
Malta on Sunday night and is expected here
on Friday morning with passengers, mails
and general cargo.
The Moss liner Menes sailed from Liverpool
on Saturday afternoon last, and is due here
on the 18th inst. with passengers, mails,
an general cargo.</p>
<head>AMERICAN GIRL SLAVE IN
    EGYPT.</head>
<head>HER HUSBAND'S TREACHERY.</head>
<p>We cull the following from a New York
oontemponry :—
The extraordinary case of Mollie Katain
who was married last July to Harry Liederer,
No. 170 Delancey street taken by him to
Egypt sold as a white slave into bondage, and
rescued by the efforts of the International
Society for the Suppression of the White Slave
Trade, has just come to light through a letter
sent by the girl to her brothers in New York.
Her courtship was a short one, and she was
married at her home, No. 132, Attorney street
last July. Four weeks later she disappeared
and was not heard of until last weak, when
the society sent her to her brothers after they
had rescued her.
Her introduction to Lederer, it was said,
was brought about by Mrs. Nathan Weber,
who lives at No. 122, Suffolk street She had
$300 in bank in her own name and this must
have been, withdrawn without her knowledge,
for in her letter she asks that her fare home
may be paid out of this money.
The letter to her brothers is in her own
handwriting and is as follows:
“My Dear Brothers—I am unable to express
the sad position in which I find myself My
husband has been treacherous and has fooled
me all along. He brought me to Alexandria and
has made me a prisoner of other men. I wish
you to go to court and get duplicates of the
documents which show that I am his wife, as
he has stolen the original papers from me.
Buy a ticket for me to return, for he has
taken all my money from me. Iam very sick
and cannot write much more. Molfie.” </p>
    <head>NEW SUDAN AGENT.</head>
<p>Captain R. C. Owen has been appointed
Director ot the Intelligence Department and
Sudan Agent at Cairo.</p>
    <head>THE PHARMACY REGULATIONS.</head>
<p>We mentioned in our issue of the 16th
ultimo two serious infringements of the new
pharmacy regulations which oome into ope-
ration about a year ago. These prove how
necessary it is for the Sanitary Adminis-
tration to use the utmost vigilance for safe-
guarding the public. In one case a Greek
named Pistis, when applying for permission
to open a pharmacy, sent in a diploma that
was ascertained to have belonged to a man
who had been dead since 1896! In the other
case three individuals sent in diplomas pur-
porting to have been issued by the Faculty
of Medicine of Athens bat which, when
subjected to expert examination, were found
to be forged.
The officials of the Department, since the
new regulations came into operation, have
taken in hand the inspection of pharmacies
but it seems they are greatly hampered by
the action of the Tribunals, who, when clear
cases of irregularities are brought to their
notice, inflict such a ridioulously small punish-
ment that it cannot possibly act as a de-
terrent. Recently, we are informed, at Man-
sourah, two individuals, one a Greek and
the other an Italian, were summoned for
keeping a pharmacy open for three months
without a certificated chemist. The Tribunal
Mixte de Contravention inflicted for this grave
offence the minimum fine of P.T. 5 in one
case and P.T. 10 in the other!</p>
    <head>NEW KHEDIVIAL HOTEL.</head>
<p>The New Khedivial Hotel at Alexandria,
whioh is at present being entirely renovated,
will be quite ready for occupation again by the
coming Christmas. It will, when completed,
contain altogether 150 bedrooms and twenty
suites of special apartments fitted with bath-
rooms, closets, and other accommodation. The
grill-room will be open on the 1st December,
and afternoon teas will be served in the new
pavilion on the terrace. A fine Tzigane band
has been specially engaged for the hotel and
will play three times a day.
A special feature of the hotel will be the
residential apartments for bachelors and fami-
lies, who will be able to live at the hotel at
an inclusive and moderate cost for board and
lodging.It is expected that this innovation
will be taken full advantage of, and owing to
the poor restaurants aud high rents at Alex-
andria such accommodation will be a great
advantage to residents.
Another special feature of the hotel will be
the cooking.The leading "chef” at the Metro-
pole Hotel, Moote Carlo, has been engaged,
and arrived on Sunday last with an entire
brigade of gastronomic artists selected with
the utmost care from among the leading
European hotels and restaurants. During the
winter the Khedivial Hotel management will
give a ball once a fortnight, as is the custom
in Cairo. There is to be a grand “Reveillon”
at the hotel at Christmas, which will be
the formal opening fete of the hotel. Every
night when there is a performance at the
Zizinia Theatre there will be a special supper
menu at a fixed inclusive price, and a band
will play from midnight until 2 p.m.
A large American bar is to be opened on
December 1, which will be equal to the finest
bar in Egypt. The hotel is under the manage-
ment of Mr. E. Fleury, late manager of the
Nonvel Hotel at Vichy and of the Alexandra
Hotel at Monte Carlo. </p>

    <head>THE RODAH LAND SALE.</head>
<p>At the recent land sale at Rodah, according
to 'Le Progres,” Dr. Nimr bade L.E. 2,470 per
feddan for tbe Menekley estate and this was
the highest bid. But owing to a dispute as
to the validity of the bid it is possible that
Maitre Carton de Wiart's offer on behalf of
an English group rail hold good. The ques-
tion will be decided at the next meeting of
the Superior Council of the Wakfs.</p>

    <head>WALKER AND MEIMARACHI.</head>
<p>The latest London papers contain the report
of the proceedings at the meeting of Walker
and Meimarachi, Limited, held in London on
Monday, Ootober 30. This ia said to be the
first English company founded in Egypt, and
owing to its good management we are sure
that the shareholders will be pleased-to hear
that the capital is to be increased so that the
company may be able to develop its business
throughout Egypt and the Sudan. The board
of directors will henceforth be in Cairo, with
only two directors in London. The company
will remain an English company and the
meetings will be held in London.</p>
<head>BIG FIRE AT ASSIOUT.</head>
<p>One of the wealthiest families at Assiout is
the Khaehabah family, writes our Assiout
Correspondent. They had four large houses at
Assiout. One was burnt down four months
ago, another two months ago, and the remain-
ing two last week. The fire broke out at
11 p.m. and in aboat two hours, the two
houses were a blazing mass. The loss is
estimated at £8,000. It is a remarkable coin-
cidence that in all three cases the cause of
this outbreak was accidental.
Our correspondent states that Assiout. is
very badly supplied with pumps. In the fire
mentioned the house was burning for a whole
hour before the pumps arrived, and after they
came it took another hour to put them in
working order.
Thanks are due to Mr. Russell, the Interior
inspector, who worked hard all night, as on
the previous occasions.</p>
    <head>NEW ENGLISH PAPERS.</head>
<p>A new illustrated political weekly, styled
"The Oriental Truth,” has just made its

civillisation and the editor and proprietor is
Captain Joge Neokan y Weldberg. There is
also an Arabic and a Freneh part in addition
to the English.
Another new English publication is “Egyp-
tian Cotton,” published at Alexandria. We
wish our new contemporaries every success.</p>

actions presentent le rare avantage d’un place-
ment aussi sur que le consolide italien a plus
da 6 pour cent.
Les noeveaux titres aeront offerts a option
aux porteurs dos anciennes actions a raison
d’une nouvelle action contre deux anciennes.
L’emission est garantie an eotier par deux
grands groupes feanciers.
Cette augmentation du capital da "Banco di
Roma” s’explique par la croissante expansion
de cet etablissement financier non senlement en
Italie maia encore a l’etranger.
En effet, les sieges de cette banque existant
a Paris et a Alexandrie d’Egypte ont donne
des resultata si encourageante que de nouvelles
succursales seront instituees dans d'autrees
pays d’Europe.
Ce succes depend aurtout de la prudence et
de l'habilete financiere de la direction qui a su
an quelques annes faire d’une petite Banque
una des plus puisantes organisations financie-
res d’ltalie.</p>

    <HEAD>THE MAIN CLAIM.</head>
<p>Mr. H.E Garle again writes to the "Times"
with references to the above, as follows:
Sir,—May I, in view of tbe references to this
matter in your issue of the 23td inst., again
trespass upon your space.
Tbe proceedings in question had nothing
whatever to do with the trial of the action and
the merits of the question were not even gone
into. The next-of-kin’s legal adviser in Egypt
was of opinion that, in all the circumstances,
the Egyptian Courts should be asked to restrain
any payment of the surplus in the hands of the
Daira Sanieh Limited to the Egyptian Govern-
ment; and this is all that was done, and is all
that has failed
The next-of-kin's main claim is against the
Egyptian Government and tho Daira Sanieh of
H.H. the Khedive ; it has not been tried, and
will not be tried for some time to come. The
proceedings that have taken-place are in truth,
little more than the equivalent to a stop order
in this country, and even so, are being appealed
against.
I earnestly trust that you will see your way
to give the same prominence to this letter that
you did to my last, for it is even more impor
tant that your statement in your issue of the
23rd inst. be answered than that in your issue-
of the 18th Inst.
I am. Sir. your obedient servant
H. Ernest Garle Solicitor the next-of-kin.
